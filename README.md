# lowfidelity Wireframes

### Description 

My project is focused on revamping the current Techcrunch website with the goal of connecting users with the content they love in a faster, simpler, and more enjoyable manner.
I previously conducted a heursitics evaluation, user interviews, and usability tests, and identified user needs and pain points. I turned my research findings into personas, scenarios, and journey maps that can be found [here.](https://github.com/anerichouhan/dh150-personas/blob/master/README.md)

My project essentially focuses on optimized content discovery. Whether it's the busy user who wants to find quick daily news on the go, the research oriented user who loves deep diving into specific content, or the archiver who loves storing and revisiting content - I want to make the TechCrunch website a space for all users to connect with the content they need seamlessly.
In order to achieve this, I chose to focus on key informational architecture changes, content categorization, and flow optimizations. I introduced features like topic tags, filters, and a personal library. I also reorganized blocks of information on the site.

I pieced together some wireframes, mapped out how they would connect into a flow, and tested them out with a user. The wireframes were focused on the following important tasks:

- **Finding & reading daily highlighted news**
- Commenting on an article
- **Finding articles specific to a topic**
- Filtering articles by length, date, author, etc.
- **Saving articles & viewing saved articles in a personal library**

## Wireframes

Here are the initial wireframes

## Wireflows
The blue arrows indicates elements connecting to new screens. The Pink arrows connect backwards.

## Testing
I tested the wireframes with a user and observed as they completed tasks. The yellow highlights indicate what the user clicked on. The number next to it shows the order in which they clicked on elements. The orange comments denote user confusion points and questions.
